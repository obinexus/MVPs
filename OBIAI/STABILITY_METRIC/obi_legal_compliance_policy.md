# OBI AI Legal Compliance Policy Framework
## For Human-Out-of-the-Loop and Human-On-the-Loop Systems

### Version 1.0 - August 2025
### OBINexus Legal Division

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This policy framework establishes legal compliance requirements for OBI AI systems operating in human-out-of-the-loop (HOTL) and human-on-the-loop (HONTL) configurations, with specific focus on:

- **Self-driving vehicles**
- **Autonomous hotel systems**
- **VAT-eligible service providers**
- **Critical infrastructure systems**

All systems must maintain **95.4% consciousness stability** as measured by the OBI Stability Metric while ensuring full regulatory compliance.

---

## 2. Definitions

### 2.1 Human Loop Classifications

**Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOTL)**
- System operates autonomously without human intervention
- Decisions execute immediately based on AI determinations
- Human oversight limited to post-facto review
- Examples: Level 5 autonomous vehicles, fully automated hotel check-in

**Human-On-the-Loop (HONTL)**
- System recommends actions to human operator
- Human retains veto power over AI decisions
- Real-time monitoring and intervention capability
- Examples: Level 3-4 autonomous vehicles, AI-assisted hotel management

**Human-In-the-Loop (HITL)**
- Human actively participates in decision cycle
- AI provides augmentation, not automation
- Human approval required for action execution
- Examples: AI-assisted diagnostics, recommendation engines

### 2.2 Stability Metrics

- **S(t)**: Consciousness stability function [-12, 12]
- **95.4% Compliance**: P(|S(t)| ≤ 3) ≥ 0.954
- **Harm Potential**: H(s,a) = σ(k₁·s + k₂·harm(a))

---
