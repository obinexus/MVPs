' Left annotation - shrinking indication

  **Shrinking Graph Principle:**
  ↓ Broad ownership base
  ↓ Focused product development
  ↓ Departmental organization
  ↓ Service specialization
  ↓ Technical implementation
  ↓ Operational deployment
  ↓ Independent sector
  
  Width decreases as
  specificity increases
